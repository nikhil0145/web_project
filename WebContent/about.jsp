   <p>
  Microsoft is a multinational computer technology corporation. Microsoft was founded on April 4,
 1975, by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in Albuquerque, New Mexico.[1] Its current best-selling 
 products are the Microsoft Windows operating system, Microsoft Office suite of productivity 
 software, Xbox, a line of entertainment of games, music and video, and Bing, a line of search engines.</p>

In 1980, Microsoft formed a partnership with IBM to bundle Microsoft's operating system 
with IBM computers; with that deal, IBM paid Microsoft a royalty for every sale. In 1985,
 IBM requested Microsoft to develop a new operating system for their computers called OS/2.
  Microsoft produced that operating system, but also continued to sell their own alternative,
   which proved to be in direct competition with OS/2. Microsoft Windows eventually overshadowed
    OS/2 in terms of sales. When Microsoft launched several versions of Microsoft Windows in the 
    1990s, they had captured over 90% market share of the world's personal computers.</p>
